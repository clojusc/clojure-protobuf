## About

This project provides a Clojure interface to Google's
[protocol buffers](http://code.google.com/p/protobuf). Protocol buffers can be
used to communicate with other languages over the network, and they are WAY
faster to serialize and deserialize than standard Clojure objects.


## Getting Started

Add the dependency to your `project.clj`:

[![Clojars Project][clojars-badge]][clojars]

Then, given a project with the following in `resources/proto/your/namespace/person.proto`:

```proto
package your.namespace.person;

option java_outer_classname = "Example";

message Person {
  required int32  id    = 1;
  required string name  = 2;
  optional string email = 3;
  repeated string likes = 4;
}
```

you can compile the proto using the protobuf compiler and include the resulting
`.java` code in your project:

```shell
protoc \
  -I=/usr/include \
  -I=/usr/local/include \
  -I=resources/proto \
  --java_out=$OUT_DIR \
  resources/proto/your/namespace/*.proto
```

Note that, at this point, the files are `.java` source files, not `.class`
files; as such, you will still need to compile them.

We've found a clean way to do this (and how we set up the tests) is to:

* put these `.java` files in an isolated directory
* add that directory to a `:java-source-paths` entry in the `project.clj`
* place that in an appropriate `project.clj` profile


## Usage

Now you can use the protocol buffer in Clojure:

```clojure
(require '[protobuf.core :as protobuf])
(import '(your.namespace.person Example$Person)

(def alice (protobuf/create Example$Person
                            {:id 108
                             :name "Alice"
                             :email "alice@example.com"}))
```

Make some changes to the data and serialize to bytes:

```clj
(def b (-> alice
           (assoc :name "Alice B. Carol")
           (assoc :likes ["climbing" "running" "jumping"])
           (protobuf/->bytes)))
```

Round-trip the bytes back to a probuf object:

```clj
(protobuf/bytes-> alice b)
```

Which gives us:

```clj
{:id 108,
 :name "Alice B. Carol",
 :email "alice@example.com",
 :likes ["climbing" "running" "jumping"]}
```

The data stored in the instance is immutable just like other clojure objects.
It is similar to a struct-map, except that you cannot insert fields that aren't
specified in the `.proto` file.

(For instance, if you do a round trip with the data like we did above, but use
`:dislikes` -- not in the protobuf definition -- instead of `:likes`,
converting from bytes back to the protobuf instance will result in the
`:dislikes` key and associated value being dropped.)


## Documentation

The above usage is a quick taste; for more examples as well as the current and
previous reference documentation, visit the
[Clojure protobuf documentation][docs]. These docs include the following:

* Basic usage example
* A Clojure port of Google's Java protobuf tutorial
* An example for working with extensions
* Clojure protobuf API Reference
* Marginalia docs
* Documentation for the two Java classes (see the "javadoc" link there)


## Release Notes

| Version             | Notes
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------
| 3.6.0-v1.2-SNAPSHOT | Bumped to latest release of protobuf-java (see the branch [release/1.2.x](https://github.com/clojusc/protobuf/tree/release/1.2.x)), added byte and stream support in constructors, added benchmarking
| 3.5.1-v1.1          | Added docs, more func renames, new abstraction layer, improved DevEx of API, and fix for enums as Clojure keywords
| 3.5.1-v1.0          | Droped extra deps, renamed functions
| 3.5.1-v0.3          | Bumped to latest release of protobuf-java, re-added tests, Travis CI support
| 3.4.0-v0.2          | Transition release; identical to the ghaskins clojure-protobuf at version  3.4.0-2-SNAPSHOT

A note on the history: This project picked up the Clojure protobuf code base
from the [ghaskins fork](https://github.com/ghaskins/clojure-protobuf); its
last significant update was 2 years prior. The work at that point had been
given the version "3.4.0-2-SNAPSHOT", tracking the Protocol Buffer release of
3.4.0. We created a branch and tag for that release with no changes other than
the org/artifact id.
